ZZZKBot - Changes
=================

Updated:    7th September 2016

Version 1.2: version submitted on 7th September 2016 for the AIIDE 2016
Starcraft AI competition. See file "SCAI2016_ENTRY.txt" for submission
details. The instructions to build and install are the same as AIIDE 2015
except that I inserted this step in INSTALL.txt that I forgot to write in
AIIDE 2015:

3. If the machine where ZZZKBot will be run does not have Microsoft Visual
Studio 2013 installed, you will need to install the 32-bit variant of the
"Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013" if not already
installed (vcredist_x86.exe (i.e. 32-bit) is only one you need for Windows
XP). Currently it can be downloaded from Microsoft's website at:
