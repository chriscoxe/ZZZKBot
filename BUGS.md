# ZZZKBot - Bugs

I am not intending to support/maintain/develop ZZZKBot in future, although I haven't ruled it out either. Do not expect me to respond to queries or support/bugfix requests unless I eventually decide to keep maintaining ZZZKBot. The project is on GitHub, at:
[https://github.com/chriscoxe/ZZZKBot](https://github.com/chriscoxe/ZZZKBot)

Feel free to report bugs and issues there if you want, but as I said, please don't expect a response/fix unless I decide to keep maintaining ZZZKBot.
